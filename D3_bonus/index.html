          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income, and Poverty Rates</h2>
          <p> <b>About the dataset:</b> This dataset is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. 'Healthcare(%)' represents the proportion of the population without healthcare. 'Age' is the median age in the state.
            'Income' is the median household income in the state. 'Poverty(%)' is the rate of poverty in the state. 'Smoke(%)' is the rate of smoking.
            'Obesity(%)' is the rate of obesity in the state. </p>

          <p><b>Correlations/Observations:</b> There is a positive correlation between poverty rate and smoking rates, where greater rates of poverty are 
            associated with higher rates of smoking. There is also a positive correlation between poverty rates and obesity, and between poverty rates and the percentage
            of the population that does not have access to healthcare.<br>There is a negative correlation between median household income(MHI) and smoking, where a higher MHI is associated
          with lower rates of smoking. There is also a negative correlation between MHI and obesity, and MHI and healthcare, where states with a higher MHI
          have lower rates of obesity, and a lower percentage of the population that does not have access to healthcare.<br>There is less variation in the median age
          in states, but a higher median age also appears to be positively correlated with a higher smoking rate, and negatively correlated with the percentage of the
          population that does not have access to healthcare. A higher median age also appears to be slightly related with higher obesity rates,
          although there are certain outlier states, such as Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire.</p>

          <p><b>Conclusions:</b> It is clear that higher poverty rates are associated with greater health risks, and that a higher median household income
            is associated with less health risks, in terms of smoking, obesity, and access to healthcare. These two metrics (poverty rate and MHI) are
            negatively correlated themselves, meaning that states with a higher poverty rate have a lower MHI, and vice versa. For example, Mississippi has one of the highest
          rates of poverty, and one of the lowest MHI. Mississippi also has one of the highest rates of smoking, obesity, and percentage of their population that does not have access to healthcare.
          <br>Not only does this illustrate the connection between financial health and physical health, but also shows the unique health risks that face poorer states and the people that live there.
          These findings highlight the health risks associated with poverty, and the potential causal relationship between poverty and health problems.</p>
