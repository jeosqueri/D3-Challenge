# Health Risks in the United States
## *An analysis of 2014 Census Data for all 50 states*

Project Overview
-------
The website for this project [is deployed here](https://jeosqueri.github.io/US-Health-Risks/).
Files for this section are in the root directory. Using D3, I created an interactive scatter plot with multiple axes that shows the relationship between multiple health risks (obesity, smoking, and lack of access to healthcare) and demographic factors (poverty rate, median household income, and median age). This scatter plot also features an interactive tooltip, which displays the information for each state based on the chosen x and y axis.

The folder **'D3-Data-Journalism'** includes the code for a basic, static scatter plot to represent the correlation between poverty rates and smoking rates in the United States.

Included in these visualizations are a description of the dataset, the observed correlations, and conclusions drawn from the data. The data used for this project is from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), and is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.
