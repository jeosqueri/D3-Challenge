# D3-Challenge- Health Risks in the United States

Assignment Overview
-------
The folder **'D3-Data-Journalism'** includes the code for the required part of the assignment, where I created a basic scatter plot to represent the correlation between poverty rates and smoking rates in the United States.

The folder **'D3-Bonus'** includes the code for the bonus part of the assignment, and is a more **thorough presentation and analysis of the data**. I created an interactive scatter plot with multiple axes that shows the relationship between multiple health risks (obesity, smoking, and lack of access to healthcare) and demographic factors (poverty rate, median household income, and median age).

Included in these visualizations are a description of the dataset, the observed correlations, and conclusions drawn from the data. The data used for this project is from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), and is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates.
